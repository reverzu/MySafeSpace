# MySafeSpace
To Create a Safe Space in a GeoFence in a way that you are considered home with real time crime monitoring.
This App was supposed to incooperate hardware with software in such a way so that the real time cameras detecting sensitive motions will send alert inside of the geofence and will be considered safe and it'll show crime according to the old records and camera tracking.
But due to our incapability of knowing and working with the tech we weren't able to make such an app.
We've learnt how to work with android studio for the first time.
But, we'll continuously work on out github repo and soon try to make a working protoype and push it.
Our goal was never to wiwn but to make friends and learn how to work in the real world.
